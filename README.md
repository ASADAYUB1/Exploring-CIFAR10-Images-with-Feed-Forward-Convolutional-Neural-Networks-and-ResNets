# Exploring-CIFAR10-Images-with-Feed-Forward-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-ResNets

This repository contains code files where I explore the CIFAR10 Dataset. In this notebook, I perform various tasks, including downloading an image dataset from a web URL and creating a Feed Forward Neural Network using PyTorch. I also delve into tasks such as understanding convolution and pooling layers, creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch, and training a CNN from scratch while monitoring its performance. Additionally, I address challenges like underfitting and overfitting, exploring techniques to overcome them. Throughout the exploration, I use various techniques, such as data normalization, data augmentation, residual connections, batch normalization, learning rate scheduling, weight decay, and gradient clipping, to train a state-of-the-art model, achieving over 90% accuracy in classifying CIFAR10 images.
